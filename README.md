My OpenStreetMap Notes 

This will use OpenStreetMap.org Notes dump (updated daily) and show you only unresolved (not-closed) Notes for specified user.

This is currently needed (as of 2015-02-01) since your user page at OSM will
only show all bugs (open and closed) mixed together sorted by date, so if
you use the Notes a lot, you'll have to wade through dozens (or hundreds!)
of pages so you can find Notes that are still open.

You can also use my <A HREF="https://torres.voyager.hr/~mnalis/my-osm-notes/">developer instance</A> directly.

(OSM Notes were previously known as OSMBugs while hosted at 3rd party servers)
